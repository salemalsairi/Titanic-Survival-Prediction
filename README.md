# 🚢 Titanic Survival Prediction

A Machine Learning project that predicts which passengers survived the Titanic shipwreck based on passenger data (Age, Gender, Class, etc.).

## 🛠️ Tools Used
- **Python**
- **Pandas** (Data Manipulation)
- **Scikit-Learn** (Logistic Regression Model)

## 📊 Project Steps
1. **Data Cleaning:** Handling missing values in Age and Fare columns.
2. **Feature Engineering:** Converting categorical data (Sex, Embarked) into numerical values using One-Hot Encoding.
3. **Model Training:** Using `LogisticRegression` to classify passengers (0 = Died, 1 = Survived).
4. **Prediction:** Generating predictions for unseen test data.

## 📁 Files
- `titanic_model.ipynb`: The main code file containing logic and analysis.
- `final_answer.csv`: The final output file with passenger names and prediction.

## 🚀 How to Run
1. Install requirements: `pip install pandas scikit-learn`
2. Run the notebook/script.
